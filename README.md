## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
-  automating and improving the flow of programming assignments for myself, my students, and any other instructors who use my materials.

-  I've also been working on creating "short-and-to-the-point" reference materials that are highly interactive and *free*, because I've been a broke college student and know what that's like. Also, many paid options are sub-par tbh.
