# Hi there 👋
<kbd><strong>[⁉️ Ask me anything](https://github.com/RuizTheRuler/RuizTheRuler/issues/new?assignees=RuizTheRuler&labels=ama&template=ama.md&title=%5BAMA%5D)</strong>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on automating and improving the flow of programming assignments for myself, my students, and any other instructors who use my materials. My goal is to incorporate automated, immediate, and actionable feedback to my students while they learn programming using the real-life tools they'll need as developers. I've been having **way too much fun with this!**. I've also been working on creating "short-and-to-the-point" reference materials that are also highly interactive (and *free*, because I've been a broke student and know what that's like).

- 🤔 I’m looking for help from anyone interested in CS education. I welcome any suggestions or contributions!!
